# Youtube and Twitter Backend

Hey there! This is my completed backend project from the Chai Aur Code series. It's been a fantastic journey, and I've learned a ton along the way.

## Functionality üõ†Ô∏è

This project aims to provide a backend infrastructure for both a YouTube-like application and a Twitter-like application. Here's what it does:

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out. User information is securely stored and passwords are hashed for security.

- **Video Upload and Retrieval**: Users can upload videos, which are stored in Cloudinary. Users can also view all videos and specific videos by ID.

- **Commenting**: Users can add comments to videos. Comments can also be viewed by video ID.

- **Tweeting**: Users can create tweets, which are stored in MongoDB. Users can also view all tweets and specific tweets by ID.

- **Following and Unfollowing**: Users can follow and unfollow other users. The list of followers and following users can be retrieved.

- **Liking and Disliking Videos**: Users can like and dislike videos. The total count of likes and dislikes for each video can be retrieved.

- **Retweeting**: Users can retweet other users' tweets. The retweets can be viewed by tweet ID.

## concepts I've learned

Here's a quick rundown of the cool features I've added to this project:

- **Node.js Powered**: The entire backend is powered by Node.js. It's the engine that drives everything on the server side, handling multiple requests efficiently.

- **Express.js Framework**: I've used Express.js, a minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It's super flexible and makes building web apps and APIs a breeze.

- **MongoDB Database**: The project uses MongoDB, a NoSQL database that's perfect for handling large amounts of data. It's like a big, organized filing cabinet for your data.

- **Error Handling**: I've implemented robust error handling in Express.js. It's all about catching mistakes and dealing with them in a neat and tidy way.

- **Mongoose ODM**: Mongoose, an elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js, is used in this project. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data.

- **Middleware Usage**: I've designed the API and used middleware extensively. They're like the gatekeepers of our app, checking everything before it gets to the main part of our code.

- **Cloudinary Integration**: The project uses Cloudinary for storing images. It's like a cloud-based gallery for all our app's pictures.

- **Advanced Concepts**: I've applied some advanced concepts like aggregation pipelines and data modeling. It's like building a complex Lego set, piece by piece, until you have a complete model.
